Build the container image.
$ cd /path/to/app
$ docker build -t getting-started .

$docker run -dp 3000:3000 getting-started
// You use the -d flag to run the new container in “detached” mode (in the background).
// You also use the -p flag to create a mapping between the host’s port 3000 to the container’s port 3000.
// Without the port mapping, you wouldn’t be able to access the application.

$docker ps
//Run the following docker ps command in a terminal to list your containers.
